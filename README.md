**Description and Functionality**

This project is a site that allows you to make a profile and post pictures. So far, the user can add their name and a short description about themself. Using JavaScript, the user can:

1. open and close a modal
2. edit the contents of a form
3. save the changes so the website reflects the user input from the form
4. Delete button deletes cards
5. Add button adds cards
6. Clicking on picture enlarges the picture

**Technologies and Techniques**

I used these functions in the following ways:

**querySelector()** was used to select elements from html

**addEventListener()** was used to check for user actions on page

**preventDefault()** was used to prevent website from following default behavior

**forEach()** was used to add cards from an array

**prepend()** was used along with <template> to add an entire card to the page at once.
