**Description and Functionality**

This project is a site that allows you to make a profile and post pictures. So far, the user can add their name and a short description about themself. Using JavaScript, the user can:

1. open and close a modal
2. edit the contents of a form
3. save the changes so the website reflects the user input from the form

**Technologies and Techniques**

I used these functions in the following ways:


querySelector() *was used to select elements from html*
addEventListener() *was used to check for user actions on page*
preventDefault() *was used to prevent website from following default behavior*
