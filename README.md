# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Pages**

* [Link to the project in Pages](thinklikeadesigner.github.io/web_project_4)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
